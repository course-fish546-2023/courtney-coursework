a. What is your goal with respect to your research project to get accomplished this week?

Blast and start working on a figure. 

b. What is the overall status of your research repo? Is it will organized with a clear Readme file? Are file names and directory clear? Would your classmates be able to understand what the code in your files is designed to do?

Research repo is organized well overall, but I think some of the file names could be improved. There are some files/folders that were auto-created when I made a presentation and had issues pushing/pulling, so I'm not sure if I can delete those. They look a bit messy. 

c. Go to one of your classmates rpubs link (see issues). What are three things you think are neat? What are two things that are really not that clear to you?

Celeste's rpubs:

1. neat layout with interactive table of contents
2. figure and caption are informative
3. comments and descrptions of each step are really detailed. they make it very easy to follow the thought process behind each chunk.

I don't have any critiques... I think that it is really well done and the goal/process/results are all very well explained.
