Week 10 Homework

**1. Looking back on the quarter what are two things you were not expecting to learn but did, glad you did, and how would you implement this knowledge beyond this class?**

A.  I was not expecting to learn how to use resources so much. I spent a lot of time on ChatGTP and google trying to piece together how something works. I appreciated having to do that because it reminded me there are so many ways to figure out a problem.
B.  As I said in the first homework assignment, I had NO experience with bioinformatics before this. Obviously, I still have a lot to learn, but I feel like I have the background necessary to be able to tackle a project on my own (and know how to get help when I get stuck).

**2. Rank the following from 1-5, with 1 being your best friend and 5 being your enemy (raven, rstudio, knitr, bash, github)**

1.  Knitr (very satisfying to see code in a pretty format)
2.  Rstudio
3.  Raven
4.  Github (here only because I often get stuck in push/pull problems)
5.  Bash (I still think the commands are so unintuitive!)

**3. As part of your research project, you must have learned something beyond methods. What is the most important biological finding from your work to date? Assuming you follow this line of research what is your long-term goal of what you expect to learn about biology, ecology, or the environment?**

Not surprisingly, I learned that snow crabs express genes differently when exposed to lower pH levels. I can tell which proteins have been up/downregulated in exposure to low pH, however, the next step of my project will be to dig into what those proteins are involved in. I would like to add the general cellular processes that these genes are associated with so that I can have a clearer idea of what responses are activated. Also, I learned a lot about cleaning up data, organizing workflows and repos, and troubleshooting, which will be really helpful as I continue to work on projects like these. I might be working with a similar set of data from king crabs in the fall, so I hope to answer questions about how climate change/bitter crab syndrome is affecting commercially important resources.
